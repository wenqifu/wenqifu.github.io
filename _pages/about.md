I'm Qifu (Danny) Wen. I spent my childhood in Shanghai and Berkely, California. Although I love playing basketball, I admit I'm not the best at it.

After earning a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from NYU Shanghai, I continued my academic journey at Boston University, where I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science.

Growing up, I was fascinated by Physics, particularly captivated by Richard Feynman's lectures. I enjoy listening his audio lectures during my free time.

My research interests are centered around Machine Learning and Statistics. Currently, I am working on a research project that compares traditional statistical software like SPSS, SAS, and JMP with a Python-based conversational agent. The goal is to determine if the conversational agent can make life easier for its users.

I'm also interested in Quantum Computing, Evolutionary Algorithms and Stochastic Differential Equations. They seemed really really really cool.
