I'm Danny (Qifu) Wen. I spent my childhood in Shanghai, China and Berkeley, California.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from NYU Shanghai, where I spent a year at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU. I subsequently earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from Boston University, where I currently work as a researcher specializing in machine learning.

My research focuses on machine learning and statistics. I have led two research projects resulting in publication in Q1 journal, including work on early stopping mechanisms for LLMs and ViTs. I regularly contribute to the academic community through submissions and peer reviews for leading machine learning conferences such as ICLR and ICRA. Looking ahead to doctoral studies, I aim to expand my research into computer vision and reinforcement learning.

Beyond my primary research areas, I maintain broad scientific interests rooted in a longstanding fascination with physics. Inspired by Richard Feynman's lectures, which I continue to enjoy in my personal time. These interests extend to quantum computing, evolutionary algorithms, and stochastic differential equations.

I welcome opportunities for collaboration across diverse research areas. Please feel free to connect via email or LinkedIn to discuss potential projects.
